# Asterisk RadIo Archetecture

__ARIA__ is an attempt to build a broadcasting system over local network which is flexible. Originally developed for in house use at [College of Engineering, Trivandrum](http://cet.ac.in). The [source code for aria is available in Github](https://github.com/AriaCET).
ARIA is highly flexible and can be addressed by each node if one wishes so. It has four parts.

 - Asterisk server at the center of the system.
 - A web interface to control the server and the grouping of nodes.
 - A transmitter client.
 - Speaker nodes
